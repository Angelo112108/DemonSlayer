    <h2>Setting</h2>
    <p>In Taishō era Japan, a secret organization known as the "Demon Slayer Corps" has waged a war against demons for centuries. Demons are former humans who possess supernatural abilities such as enhanced strength, rapid regeneration, and unique powers referred to as "Blood Demon Arts". Demons can only be killed if they are exposed to direct sunlight, decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy called Nichirin, or injected with a poison extracted from wisteria flowers.</p>
    <p>In contrast, the Demon Slayers are entirely human but employ specialized elemental breathing techniques known as "Breathing Styles". These techniques grant them superhuman strength, heightened abilities, and increased resilience that enable them to fight demons effectively. The most formidable Demon Slayers are known as the "Hashira" and gain this title through multiple advancements in the Corps' ranks, culminating in killing fifty demons at the highest level or a member of the Twelve Kizuki.</p>

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and diligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. After the death of his father, he becomes the sole provider for his household, selling charcoal in nearby villages. He returns home one day to discover his family has been slaughtered by a demon. His younger sister, Nezuko, is the only survivor, though she has been transformed into a demon herself. She exhibits the unusual trait of retaining some human emotion and cognition. The pair are discovered by Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, who sends Tanjiro to be trained by his own former mentor, Sakonji Urokodaki. Tanjiro vows to become a Demon Slayer to avenge his family and find a way to return Nezuko to humanity.
       After mastering the "Water Breathing" swordsmanship style, Tanjiro passes the Corps' final selection. Nezuko, who has been placed under a hypnotic suggestion by Urokodaki to suppress her demonic urges, accompanies him. During a mission in Asakusa, they encounter Muzan Kibutsuji, the progenitor of all demons and the one responsible for the murder of their family. They also befriend Tamayo and her assistant Yushiro, two demons who have freed themselves from Muzan's control. Tamayo agrees to develop a cure for Nezuko, a process that requires blood from the powerful Twelve Kizuki, Muzan's most elite subordinates.</p>
    <p>Tanjiro and Nezuko are joined in their mission by fellow Demon Slayers Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. Together, they defeat several members of the Twelve Kizuki. During a fierce battle, Tanjiro awakens a mysterious and powerful swordsmanship technique known as "Hinokami Kagura". Their actions draw the attention of the Hashira, the Corps' highest-ranking swordsmen, and they are brought before the organization's leader, Kagaya Ubuyashiki. He sanctions their continued partnership, believing the siblings are pivotal to defeating Muzan.
       Muzan, enraged by the failures of his remaining Lower Ranks, executes all of them except for Lower One, who he sends to kill Tanjiro. After a battle aboard a moving train, Tanjiro prevails with the aid of the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku, who is subsequently killed by the Upper Three demon, Akaza. The group continues their campaign, assisting the Sound Hashira in defeating the Upper Six siblings and later helping the Mist and Love Hashira eliminate Upper Five and Upper Four at the Swordsmith Village. During these events, Nezuko develops an immunity to sunlight, making her the key to Muzan's goal of overcoming his own fatal weakness. Tanjiro also learns that his Hinokami Kagura is derived from "Sun Breathing," the original swordsmanship style created by Breathing progenitor Yoriichi Tsugikuni.</p>
